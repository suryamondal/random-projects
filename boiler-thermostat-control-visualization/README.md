# Boiler Thermostat Control Visualisation

Modern boiler thermostats (i.e. `Honeywell CM907`) comes with different
temperature set periods. The number of times the set temperature can be changed
depends on the model of the thermostat, but typically is 4 to 6. One might also
set different temperature for different days of the week.

In this project, I tried to simulate the temperature throughout the week and
represent it in a nice 2D histogram.
