# Plot GPX data

Main goal of this project is to plot how trains move in time. I do not have complete data for a `Marey chart`, but a partial plot can give idea why India trains are always late.

## Getting Started

Most working scripts are in the directory `scripts`.
| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `env.sh` | source `basf2` environment |
| `plot-marey-chart.py` | main script for testing |

## Dependencies

```BASH
pip install gpxpy
```
